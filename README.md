# 🎴 CobbleDuel

A Minecraft mod inspired by Yu-Gi-Oh!, focused on delivering a cinematic and immersive dueling experience — summoning monsters in 3D, just like in the anime.

---

## 📌 About

CobbleDuel is a project that brings classic Yu-Gi-Oh! duel mechanics to Minecraft, featuring:

- Custom 3D models for each monster  
- Cinematic summoning with immersive camera positioning  
- Duel field styled after the anime, with the duelist behind and the monster in front  

This mod takes inspiration from [YgoDuelingMod](https://github.com/CAS-ual-TY/YgoDuelingMod), especially its integration with YGOPRODeck, but aims for a different approach — focused on visuals, simplicity, and anime-style presence.

## 🛠 Current Progress

- ✅ Project environment set up using **NeoGradle 1.21.1 + NeoForge**
- ✅ All textures, and resource folders are in place and organized
- ⚠️ No code implementation yet — mechanics and logic are still to be developed
- 🗂 This repo currently serves as the **starting structure** for future development

## 🎯 Roadmap

- [ ] Port item registration and summoning logic from YgoDuelingMod  
- [ ] Animate custom monsters manually (without external libraries)  
- [ ] Build duel field system with positioning and state logic  
- [ ] Add basic attack/idle animations through code  
- [ ] Polish UI, camera and effects for immersive duels
